/*
Tests spring's built in asynchronous capabilities

Spring doesnâ€™t just create a new thread for every request but instead uses a pool with worker threads (named 'http-nio-8080-exec-#') that handle these requests.
By default it has 10 of these workers allowing it to handle 10 requests in parallel

    /*
    An easy fix for this is to wrap our response in a Callable. Spring automatically knows that when it receives a callable,
    it should be considered a 'slow' call and should be executed on a different thread
    Callable, spring creates a new thread for each slow thread allowing new requests not to get blocked

    When it receives a Callable from a controller it spins up a new thread to handle it


    Creating threads is relatively expensive and with an unbounded maximum your application server can run out of memory and crash
    This behavior, as well as the name, configured through a WebMvcConfigurer bean
